# 📊 Retail Analytics Dashboard: Executive Insights
## Project Overview
This comprehensive 4-page Power BI dashboard analyzes the performance of 365 Retail across Financials, Product Strategy, Logistics, and Customer Demographics. The analysis covers the period through November 2024, focusing on identifying growth levers and operational inefficiencies.

### 1. Executive Summary: The "Growth vs. Cost" Paradox
- Performance: Total Sales reached $847K, with a healthy 3.3% MoM growth.

- Efficiency Gap: While revenue is up, Total Orders dropped by 5.7%. This indicates a shift toward higher-value transactions (increased AOV) but suggests a potential struggle with customer acquisition volume.

- The Global Shift: International sales now represent 45% of total revenue, a massive jump that is currently the primary engine of growth but also the primary driver of rising costs.

### 2. Logistics & Operational Impact
- Shipping Cost Crisis: Logistics expenses surged by 150.6%. The Average Shipping per Order rose to $24.70.

- Category Stress: The "Other" category is a major drain on resources. Shipping costs consume 58.31% of its revenue, compared to only 13.65% for Clothing.

- Economies of Scale: Data from June 2024 confirms a "Historical Efficiency Gap"—shipping costs peaked when order volume was lowest, highlighting the need for a more flexible logistics contract.

### 3. Product & Customer Sentiment
- The "Star" Product: BF1548 is the clear leader, generating $191K in revenue.

- Quality Warning: There is a significant disconnect in the "Other" category (Product BF1555), which holds a poor 2.0 rating. Reviews cite "subpar detailing" and "not as advertised."

- Demographic Powerhouse: Males aged 18-22 and 31-35 are the most loyal segments, contributing over $477K in lifetime value.

### 💡 Strategic Recommendations
- 🚚 Audit Domestic Logistics: Despite higher international costs, domestic orders account for 69% of "Not Satisfied" reviews. We must address "careless handling" in the final-mile delivery to protect the brand's reputation.

- 📦 Bundle for Profitability: Single-item orders are the most common but have the highest shipping-to-revenue ratio. Implementing "Buy 2+ items" incentives for Clothing could drastically improve margins.

- ✂️ Rationalize the Portfolio: I recommend a phased exit from the "Other" category. With a 58% shipping impact and low ratings, it is a "cash trap" that dilutes overall profitability.

- 🌍 Dynamic Shipping Rates: Given the 75.9% spike in international demand, the business should transition from flat-rate shipping to dynamic pricing to offset the $25.06 average shipping cost.


Advanced DAX: Created measures for MoM Growth %, Shipping-to-Revenue ratios, and Sentiment distribution.

Data Visualization: Utilized Sankey diagrams for demographic flows, Donut charts for market mix, and Trend lines with forecasting.
